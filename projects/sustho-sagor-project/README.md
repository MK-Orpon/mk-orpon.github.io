## Project Overview

The **Sustho Sagor (Healthy Ocean) Project** is a large-scale marine conservation initiative led by **WCS Bangladesh** in partnership with **WorldFish** and supported by the **Blue Action Fund**. The project aims to expand and strengthen Bangladesh’s Marine Protected Area (MPA) network, safeguarding over **12,700 km² of critical marine habitat** across the Bay of Bengal.

Over five years, Sustho Sagor will enhance management effectiveness in the **Swatch of No Ground** and **Nijhum Dwip MPAs**, establish Bangladesh’s first marine **Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measure (OECM)**, and improve biodiversity monitoring, fisheries governance, and community resilience. The initiative supports more than **155,000 coastal residents** dependent on marine resources while advancing Bangladesh’s commitment to protecting **30% of its ocean area by 2030**.

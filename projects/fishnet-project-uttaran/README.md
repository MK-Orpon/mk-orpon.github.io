##  Project Overview

The **FISHNET Project** is a coastal fisheries and livelihood development initiative implemented by **UTTARAN**, aimed at addressing poverty, environmental degradation, and governance challenges in Bangladesh’s coastal fishing communities.

Fisherfolk along the coast of Bangladesh remain trapped in cycles of poverty due to heavy dependence on marine resources, widespread overfishing, unsustainable fishing techniques, marine pollution, and illegal bottom trawling by large-scale operators. These pressures have severely degraded marine ecosystems and reduced fish stocks, threatening both biodiversity and livelihoods.

The project seeks to tackle these challenges by **empowering marginalized fisherfolk communities** through inclusive decision-making, community-based resource management, and conservation-led development approaches. A flagship component of the project is the establishment of **Bangladesh’s first community-managed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**, designed to conserve marine ecosystems while ensuring equitable access to resources.

FISHNET also promotes **livelihood diversification, financial inclusion, women’s empowerment, and the reduction of child labour** in hazardous marine occupations. The project collaborates with coastal aquaculture entrepreneurs to encourage sustainable practices and restore degraded coastal ecosystems.

The project aims to directly support:
- **10,000 marginalized sea-going fisherfolk families**
- **Approximately 3,000 women** engaged in wild shrimp larvae collection
- **At least 850 households** with children involved in unsafe marine work

This research assignment contributes to evidence-based analysis and field-level insights supporting sustainable fisheries management, community resilience, and policy-relevant outcomes.

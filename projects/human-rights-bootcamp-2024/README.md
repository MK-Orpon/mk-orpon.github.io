## Project Overview

The **Human Rights Bootcamp 2024** was a community-based youth leadership initiative implemented under SURGE Bangladesh. As Team Leader, I led a project titled **“Climate Justice: Ensuring Human Rights for All”**, focusing on strengthening awareness of the intersection between climate change and human rights among secondary-level students in the Chattogram region.

Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to climate-induced disasters despite minimal contributions to global emissions. These impacts disproportionately affect fundamental human rights, including the rights to life, health, education, housing, and livelihood. The project addressed these challenges through interactive workshops, civic education sessions, and community engagement.
